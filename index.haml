  %h3 2. Review of Compression Algorithms

%section
  %h4 Types of compression
  %br/
  %ul
    %li Lossless compression: The original data stream is fully recovered
    %li Losy compression: The original data stream cannot be recovered. However, a new data stream is created that closely resembles the original.

%section
  %h4 Lossless compression
  %br/
  %ul
    %li Exploits patterns on the data stream
    %li Each pattern found is expressed with a symbol (Dictionary) or a magnitude (Statistical, Arithmetic)
    %li It has a lower limit, lossless compression cannot go beyond certain ratio.

%section
  %h4 Classic lossy compression algorithms
  %br/
  %ul
    %li Sound: FLAC  (Statistical)
    %li Image: PNG (Dictionary)
    %li Video: VP9

%section
  %h4 Lossy compression
  %br/
  %ul
    %li Requires a mathematical transform that takes the data form the spatial domain to another one like frequency domain or wavelet domain.
    %li The search for patterns are done on the transform domain.
    %li Data is drop on the transform domain by truncating the coefficients (quantization).

%section
  %h4 Classic lossy compression algorithms
  %br/
  %ul
    %li Sound: MP3  (DCT)
    %li Image: JPEG (DCT)
    %li Video: H.264 (iDCT)

%section
  %h3 Proposed Model: Fovea Hierarchical Trees

%section
  %h4 Lossy image compression
  %br/
  %ul
    %li Most common transform is the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
    %li The image is split on squares of 8x8 pixels. 
    %li The transform is applied to each square and the coefficient matrix is multiplied by a quantization matrix.
    %li The quantized coefficients are sorted and compressed using huffman encoding.

%section

  %h4 Fovea Compression

  %ul
    %li Exploits the structure of the human eye.
    %li The human eye percieve less detail from areas further away from the fixation point 
    %li The sensibility to details decreases logarithmically
